# Tris
This program will run a Tris game that will end in. a win or in a loss, but can't be drew.
After both of the players have done their third move, the previous move will start to disappear.
It will start from the first move, than the second, the third and so on until tha game end with the win of one of the players.

This is my first project with Python, I will appreciate any raccomandations.
Thank You, 
Luca
